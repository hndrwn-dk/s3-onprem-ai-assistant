# 🖥️ Testing Guide: Enterprise Desktop AI Assistant

This guide will help you test the newly improved **Enterprise-Grade Desktop AI Assistant** (`ultra_modern_app.py`) with professional interface and business-ready features.

## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites Check

Ensure you have the following installed:

```bash
# Check Python version (3.8+ required)
python --version

# Check if Ollama is installed
ollama --version

# Check if required model is available
ollama list | grep phi3
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install required packages (including pywebview for desktop app)
pip install pywebview
pip install -r requirements.txt

# If you encounter issues, try upgrading pip first
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pywebview -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Setup Ollama Model

```bash
# Pull the required model (this may take a few minutes)
ollama pull phi3:mini

# Verify the model is installed
ollama list
```

### 4️⃣ Prepare Test Environment

```bash
# Create necessary directories
mkdir -p docs cache

# Create test documents for demonstration
echo "# S3 Bucket Management Guide

## Engineering Department Buckets
