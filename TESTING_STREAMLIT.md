# 🧪 Testing Guide: Enterprise Streamlit UI

This guide will help you test the newly improved **Enterprise-Grade Streamlit UI** for the S3 On-Prem AI Assistant.

## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites Check

Ensure you have the following installed:

```bash
# Check Python version (3.8+ required)
python --version

# Check if Ollama is installed
ollama --version

# Check if required model is available
ollama list | grep phi3
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# If you encounter issues, try upgrading pip first
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Setup Ollama Model

```bash
# Pull the required model (this may take a few minutes)
ollama pull phi3:mini

# Verify the model is installed
ollama list
```

### 4️⃣ Prepare Test Environment

```bash
# Create necessary directories
mkdir -p docs cache

# Optional: Create some test documents
echo "Test S3 bucket documentation for engineering department" > docs/test_doc.txt
echo "MinIO configuration guide for production deployment" > docs/minio_guide.txt
```

## 🎯 Running the Enterprise UI

### Start the Application

```bash
# Run the Streamlit application
streamlit run streamlit_ui.py

# Alternative: Run on specific port
streamlit run streamlit_ui.py --server.port 8501

# Alternative: Run with custom host
streamlit run streamlit_ui.py --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.port 8501
```

The application should open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🧪 Testing Features

### 1️⃣ Visual Interface Testing

**✅ Check Enterprise Design Elements:**
- [ ] **Header**: Dark gradient header with "🏢 Enterprise AI Assistant" title
- [ ] **Typography**: Clean Inter font throughout the interface  
- [ ] **Cards**: Glass-morphism cards with subtle shadows
- [ ] **Metrics Dashboard**: 4-column performance metrics at the top
- [ ] **Professional Colors**: Slate/blue enterprise color scheme
- [ ] **Icons**: Meaningful icons throughout (🚀, 🔍, 📊, etc.)

**✅ Responsive Design:**
- [ ] Resize browser window - interface should adapt
- [ ] Check on mobile viewport (F12 → mobile view)
- [ ] Cards should stack properly on smaller screens

### 2️⃣ Performance Metrics Testing

**✅ System Performance Dashboard:**
- [ ] **LLM Response**: Should show load time (e.g., "2.34s")
- [ ] **Vector Search**: Should show "N/A" initially, then timing after first vector search
- [ ] **Cache Hit Rate**: Should show "0.0%" initially, then increase with repeated queries
- [ ] **Status**: Should show "Online" in green

### 3️⃣ Query Interface Testing

**✅ Basic Query Testing:**

1. **Test Quick Search:**
   ```
   Query: "show buckets for engineering"
   Expected: Quick bucket search results with professional styling
   ```

2. **Test Vector Search:**
   ```
   Query: "how to configure MinIO for production"
   Expected: Vector search with AI processing (if docs exist)
   ```

3. **Test Cache Functionality:**
   ```
   - Run the same query twice
   - Second run should show "⚡ Cached Result" badge
   - Response time should be <0.1s
   ```

**✅ Advanced Features:**
- [ ] **AI Format Toggle**: Check "🤖 AI Format" - should enhance responses
- [ ] **Clear Cache**: Click "🗑️ Clear Cache" - should show success message
- [ ] **Query History**: Previous queries should appear in "📝 Recent Queries"

### 4️⃣ Data Management Testing

**✅ File Upload Testing:**

1. **Expand Data Management Section:**
   - Click "📁 Data Management" to expand

2. **Test File Upload:**
   ```bash
   # Create test files
   echo "S3 bucket policy documentation" > test_policy.txt
   echo "# MinIO Admin Guide" > test_admin.md
   ```
   - Upload these files using the file uploader
   - Click "📤 Upload Files"
   - Should show "✅ Successfully uploaded X file(s)"

3. **Test Index Rebuild:**
   - Click "🔄 Rebuild Index" 
   - Should show spinner with "Rebuilding knowledge base..."
   - Should show "✅ Knowledge base successfully updated"

### 5️⃣ Error Handling Testing

**✅ Error Scenarios:**

1. **No Ollama Running:**
   ```bash
   # Stop Ollama temporarily
   sudo systemctl stop ollama  # Linux
   # or kill ollama process
   
   # Try a query - should show professional error message
   ```

2. **Invalid Query:**
   ```
   Query: ""
   Expected: Should not process empty queries
   ```

3. **Network Issues:**
   - Simulate network issues and test error handling

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance Targets:

| Test Type | Target Time | Status Indicator |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Cached Query** | < 0.1s | ⚡ Cached Result |
| **Quick Search** | 0.1-0.5s | 🚀 Quick Search |
| **Vector Search** | 1-3s | 🎯 Vector Search |
| **Fallback Search** | 2-5s | 🔄 Fallback Search |

### Performance Testing Script:

```bash
# Create a simple performance test
cat > test_performance.py << 'EOF'
import time
import requests

def test_query_performance():
    queries = [
        "show buckets for engineering",
        "MinIO configuration",
        "S3 bucket policies",
        "show buckets for engineering",  # Repeat for cache test
    ]
    
    for i, query in enumerate(queries):
        print(f"Test {i+1}: {query}")
        start = time.time()
        # Manual testing via UI - record times
        print(f"Manual timing needed via UI")
        print("---")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_query_performance()
EOF

python test_performance.py
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions:

1. **"ModuleNotFoundError" Errors:**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Ollama Connection Issues:**
   ```bash
   # Check if Ollama is running
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
   
   # Restart Ollama if needed
   ollama serve
   ```

3. **Port Already in Use:**
   ```bash
   # Use different port
   streamlit run streamlit_ui.py --server.port 8502
   ```

4. **Styling Not Loading:**
   - Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check browser console for errors

5. **Vector Search Failing:**
   ```bash
   # Rebuild embeddings
   python build_embeddings_all.py
   ```
