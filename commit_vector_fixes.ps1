git commit -m "Fix vector search fallback issue and add diagnostics

Features:
- Add diagnose_vector_search.py for troubleshooting vector search issues
- Add comprehensive VECTOR_SEARCH_TROUBLESHOOTING.md guide
- Enhance build_embeddings_all.py with better validation and logging
- Improve model_cache.py with proper vector index checking
- Add utility functions to distinguish real documents from sample file
- Better error messages and diagnostics for air-gapped environments
- Support for Windows PowerShell commands in documentation

Fixes:
- Vector search no longer falls back to sample_bucket_metadata_converted.txt
- Proper validation of uploaded documents vs sample file
- Enhanced logging and error reporting
- Better support for air-gapped deployments with local Ollama

This resolves the issue where vector search would always use the sample 
file instead of processing uploaded S3 vendor PDFs/documents."
